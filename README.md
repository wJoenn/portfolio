## Portfolio website
![1681382520589](https://github.com/wJoenn/portfolio/assets/75388869/6f1201b9-c360-4a46-9702-badfb0a2cd29)

This is a very modest portfolio website hosted as a github page.
It serves a simple way for me to display the projects I've worked on so far.<br>
You can visit it on [louisramos.dev](https://louisramos.dev)

This portfolio was made a couple of days and will probably be reworked a few times over the years to fit my current Tech Stack, my new design preferences and to update my list of projects.
The current state of the website was setup using my [stimulus + scss template](https://github.com/wJoenn/stimulus-boilerplate)
